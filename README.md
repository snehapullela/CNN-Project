# Human similairty detection using DETR and VGGFace
A human similairty model using DETR and VGG has been developed in python. The code contains four sections. <br />
Section I : Loading images and creating image pairs <br />
Section II : Creating a Human Similairty model using VGGFace as a feature extractor <br />
Section III : Object Detection model using DETR <br />
Section IV : Testing human similairty between two images using DETR and model constrctucted in Section II <br />
Section V : Results <br />

Reference to the dataset on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/5-celebrity-faces-dataset

The results in the Section V depicts the prediction score of the image pairs along with displaying the similar person that the model detected.

Installation and running the code: <br />
The code was developed using Google colab. Due to this, installing the required packages has been done in the code. <br />
1. Launch the notebook using google colab. <br />
2. Import the data to the google drive <br />
3. Establish connection between the drive and google colab(Code present in the jupyter notebook) <br />
4. Then execute the code.
