# Human similairty detection using DETR and VGGFace
A human similairty model using DETR and VGG has been developed in python. The code contains four sections. <br />
Section I : Loading images and creating image pairs <br />
Section II : Creating a Human Similairty model using VGGFace as a feature extractor <br />
Section III : Object Detection model using DETR <br />
Section IV : Testing human similairty between two images using DETR and model constrctucted in Section II <br />
Section V : Results <br />
